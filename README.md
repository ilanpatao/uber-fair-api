# uber-fair-api

<b>Description:</b>

Sample of pulling real-time fair estimates from Uber's API service; the results will return full fare information along with other metadeta about each available ride type (Pool, Black, Uber X, etc.) from one destination to another. The JSON feed will also include along with fair estimates other information such as tolls, minimum, base and price per minute data.

<hr><b>Technical:</b>
PHP CURL XHR request to uber.com requesting fair estimates from two seperate Google Place IDs. <b>Google Places</b> IDs are required for the service to identify each location properly, by using this code you must be able to pass a Google Place ID obtained either at:<br>
<ul>
<li>https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder</li>
<li>https://gmb.reviewsmaker.com</li>
<li>Recommendation: Use the Google Maps and Places libraries to integrate this code to build an easy address finder.</li>
</ul>
